NuPeak from Blast: 14.8 +/- 1.0
Wpeak warning: Flux too close to background. Low flux variability and large IR spectral slope. That is likely because the IR flux is dominated by the host galaxy or IR torus. 
Source contamination for Wpeak: There are no confusing sources at this position. The closest object is located at 15 arcseconds
Flux ratio from variability in IR: 1.4
