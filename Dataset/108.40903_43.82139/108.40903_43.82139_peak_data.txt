NuPeak from Blast: 12.1 +/- 0.3
Wpeak warning: Not enough flux variability. Very small or no spectral slope variability. That is likely because the IR flux is dominated by the host galaxy or IR torus. 
Source contamination for Wpeak: There are no confusing sources at this position. The closest object is located at 18 arcseconds
Flux ratio from variability in IR: 1.2
