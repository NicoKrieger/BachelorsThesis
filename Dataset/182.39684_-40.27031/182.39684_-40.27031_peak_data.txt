NuPeak from Blast: 13.2 +/- 0.8
Wpeak warning: Not enough flux variability. Very small or no spectral slope variability. That is likely because the IR flux is dominated by the host galaxy or IR torus. 
Source contamination for Wpeak: Possible confusing source at distance of 7 arcseconds, vmag=100.0
Flux ratio from variability in IR: 1.2
