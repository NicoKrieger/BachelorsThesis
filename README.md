# BachelorsThesis

This GitHub project provides the accompanying datasets and catalogs to the Bachelor Thesis by Nicolas Krieger with the title **"On the Classification of Blazars"**.

In the directory **Dataset**, you can find a folder for every one of the 6747 blazars of the catalog. These are named "right ascension of the blazar," underscore "declination of the blazar," and contain all the information used for the analysis. This includes:
1. The SED data as text and CSV files
2. A text file with the hydrogen column density $n_h$ given in the unit 1/$\textit{cm}^{-2}$
3. A text file with the BlaST and W-peak synchrotron peak prediction, including W-peak warning and angular distance to the closest source of confusion
4. A PNG plot of the NEOWISE infrared flux and slope
5. A PNG plot displaying the SED data together with the BlaST and W-peak synchrotron peak predictions
